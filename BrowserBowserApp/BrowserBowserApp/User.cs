/*
 * File: User.cs
 * Purpose: User-related classes and functionality for BrowserBowser application
 * 
 * Description:
 * This file is intended to contain user management classes, data structures, and
 * related functionality for the BrowserBowser application. Currently empty but
 * reserved for future user authentication, authorization, and profile management features.
 * 
 * Logic:
 * - Currently contains only namespace declaration
 * - Placeholder for user-related functionality
 * - May include user authentication, session management, and user preferences
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - When implemented, will need secure user authentication mechanisms
 * - User data storage should be encrypted and properly validated
 * - Session management should use secure tokens and proper expiration
 * - User input validation will be critical to prevent injection attacks
 * - Password handling should follow secure hashing best practices
