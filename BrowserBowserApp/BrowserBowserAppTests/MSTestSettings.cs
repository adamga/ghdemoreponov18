/*
 * File: MSTestSettings.cs
 * Purpose: MSTest framework configuration and assembly-level test settings
 * 
 * Description:
 * This file contains assembly-level attributes and configuration settings for MSTest
 * unit testing framework. It configures test execution behavior, parallelization
 * settings, and other test runner parameters for the BrowserBowserApp test suite.
 * 
 * Logic:
 * - Sets Parallelize attribute to enable method-level parallel test execution
 * - Configures MSTest framework execution scope and behavior
 * - Assembly-level settings apply to all test classes in the project
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - Parallel test execution may expose race conditions or shared state issues
 * - Test isolation important to prevent cross-test data contamination
 * - Test execution environment should be isolated from production systems
 * - Ensure test data doesn't contain sensitive information
